Instructions for running code locally

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Java on your local machine (if not, follow instructions here https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/15/install/installation-jdk-macos.html)
2. Make sure you have latest version of Python (follow instructions- https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
3. Download Pycharm (or any other IDE of your choice) if you do not have it already
4. Create a folder called input_data
5. Make sure to copy all three csv files from https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jhQxhGVmxVF8MlsUnSITVxIjGwEOxJnr/edit#
and put them in the input_data folder. I did  not include them in this repo as they were too large, and git pushes kept timing out
6. Once those files are in input folder, make sure they are named cons.csv, cons_email.csv, and cons_email_chapter_subscription.csv respectively
7. Go to the create_dfs.py file
8. right click anywhere in the file and select "Run create_dfs"
9. Output will be shown in run terminal
